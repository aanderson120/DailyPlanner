## Special Thanks
I collaborated with [Brooklynne Audette](https://github/B-Audette), [Dortea Flores-Kestner](https://github/dfkestner), and [Lindsey Bordner](https://LindseyM20). We were able to talk through the pseudocoding to simplify the code and were able to help each other debug when we came across issues.
